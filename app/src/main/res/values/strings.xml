    <string name="how_doze_works_dialog_text">How Doze mode works on your device:\n\nIf a user leaves a device unplugged and stationary for a period of time (30 mins), with the screen off, the device enters Doze mode. In Doze mode, the system attempts to conserve battery by restricting apps\' access to network and CPU-intensive services. It also prevents apps from accessing the network and defers their jobs, syncs, and standard alarms\n\nPeriodically, the system exits Doze for a brief time to let apps complete their deferred activities. During this maintenance window, the system runs all pending syncs, jobs, and alarms, and lets apps access the network\n\nAt the conclusion of each maintenance window, the system again enters Doze, suspending network access and deferring jobs, syncs, and alarms. Over time, the system schedules maintenance windows less and less frequently, helping to reduce battery consumption in cases of longer-term inactivity when the device is not connected to a charger.\n\nAs soon as the user wakes the device by moving it, turning on the screen, or connecting a charger, the system exits Doze and all apps return to normal activity\n\nHow Carbonite works:\n\nCarbonite makes the device enter Doze mode immediately after screen off (or after a user specified delay), instead of waiting for 30 mins for the device to become stationary. On top of that, Carbonite also turns of the device\'s motion sensors, so Doze doesn\'t deactivate if you move your device. Doze will only deactivate during a maintenance window (as explained above) or when you turn on your screen, which means your device will stay in Doze mode for a much longer time even if the device\'s screen is off and the device is not stationary, which means the battery savings will be a lot higher than normal Doze.</string>
